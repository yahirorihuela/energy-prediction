# energy-prediction
Name: Building Energy Usage Prediction Model

Intention: In an effort to assist property owners, my neural network would utilize energy-consumption related variables such as business hours, building age, property area, and occupancy to guess the energy-consumption of a building within a reasonable timeframe (I am not quite sure how far into the future my model would fare, I will decide this later and delete this portion of the message.)

Author's Note: This is my first project dabbling in neural networks. Unsurprisingly, this is also my first project with the scikit-learn and tensorflow libraries. Hopefully this work precludes a day in the future in which I can confidently say that I have decently incorporated ML into my CS know-how. 

Projected Project Process:
(1) Getting data [probably csv, probably from the government]
(2) Writing code to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.
    - Emphasis on "analyze", data will be analyzed with a neural network, which is mostly uncharted territory for myself.
    - visualization will be done with matplotlib in all likelihood
